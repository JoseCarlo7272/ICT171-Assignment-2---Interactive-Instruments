171 Assignment 2 Cloud Project
Hello my name is Jose, in this github repository, you are viewing my cloud project known as interactive instruments.
This project consists of having the option to play and utilize 4 instruments that of which are piano, guitar, drums and violin.
The purpose of this project is to have a free tool for people to use and learn instruments from,
originally there was supposed to be a section with free music theory knowledge however after countless testing,
it is proven that relying on external sources for music theory is a much better option.
Although the entire purpose of this tool is to allow people to learn how to utilize and understand these instruments
without having to buy a physical instrument, not when they are ready, using tools like these allow people to know whether
they want to invest their time and money on learning an instrument.
